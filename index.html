  Music is one of the  most important and most loved things in our society, it is one of the things  that people bond and connect over more than anything. It is something that  unites people worldwide as it is something that is prominent in every society  and binds us all together. Millions of people worldwide have formed lifelong  friendships over a shared love for music, whether that's from playing the same  instrument and practicing or jamming out together to try and help each other  improve, or if you play different instruments and form a band or many  friendships are formed at gigs where there is a shared love for the performer  or online friendships as there are many communities online that are fandoms,  for example, Justin Bieber fans label themselves believers and reach out to  each other on social media sites like Twitter. There are so many reasons that  people have a deep love for music, but many people are unaware that it can  actually help to transform your life. Music has such an effect on us and it is  almost always positive, this can actually be used to help change your life for  the better.
  
  Just remember how much of an art music is. You have to strike the balance of showcasing it with visuals while at the same time not overthrowing the major element, which is music, with how your music website looks.
  
  Your website has to be aesthetically pleasing while at the same time keeping the focus on the music it contains.
  
  Overall though, since the selling point is user-experience, people who go to your music website should get the satisfaction that they will find the emotion-evoking songs they like.
