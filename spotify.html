He has had  many hit songs appear all over the range of relaxing pop playlists that  Spotify provides featuring songs like Blinding Lights and Starboy to name a  few.</p>
<p>Macklemore<br>

<p>Lewis Capaldi<br>

Lewis is known for the  high range of his voice and his love story appeal that he brings to his music  and this has done him very well in terms of creating some pretty good music. He  has been seen on many Spotify official playlists and for good reason with his  relaxing songs, I don't think that his success is going to falter any time  soon.</p>
